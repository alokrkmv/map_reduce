with observation confident in his knowledge proud of his eloquence and declining into dotage a man positive and confident because he knows his mind was once strong and knows not that it is become weak the idea of dotage encroaching upon wisdom will solve all the phenomena of the character of polonius ii2 his bulk frame ii3 ecstacy of love ie madness of love in this sense the word is now obsolete ii4 this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love ie this must be made known to the king for being kept secret the hiding hamlets love might occasion more mischief to us from him and the queen than the uttering or revealing of it will occasion hate and resentment from hamlet it was the custom of shakespeares age to conclude acts and scenes with a couplet a custom which was continued for nearly a century afterwards ii5 the understanding of himself ie the just estimate of himself ii6 vouchsafe your rest please to reside ii7 of us ie over us ii8 in the full bent to the full stretch and range—a term derived from archery ii9 the trail of policy the trail is the course of an animal pursued by the scent ii10 expostulate to expostulate is to discuss to put the pros and cons to answer demands upon the question expose is an old term of similar import ii11 perpend ie reflect consider attentively ii12 most beautified ophelia heywood in his history of edward vi says katharine parre queen dowager to king henry viii was a woman beautified with many excellent virtues the same expression is frequently used by other old authors ii13 in her excellent white bosom the ladies in shakespeares time wore pockets in the front of their stays ii14 these c in our poets time the word these was usually added at the end of the superscription of letters ii15 i am ill at these numbers no talent for these rhymes ii16 o most best an ancient mode of expression ii17 whilst this machine is to him belongs to obey his impulse so long as he is a sensible warm motion the similar expression to while my wits are my own ii18 and more above ie moreover besides ii19 his solicitings ie his lovemaking his tender expressions ii20 if i had played the desk or table book this line may either mean if i had conveyed intelligence between them or known of their love if i had locked up his secret in my own breast as closely as it were confined in a desk or table book ii21 or given my heart a winking mute and dumb ie connived at it ii22 with idle sight ie with indifference ii23 round to work ie roundly without reserve ii24 which done she took the fruits of my advice she took the fruits of advice when she obeyed advice the advice was then made fruitful—johnson ii25 ill board him presently accost address him ii26 you are a fishmonger this was an expression better understood in shakespeares time than at present and no doubt was relished by the audience of the globe theatre as applicable to the papists who in queen elizabeths time were esteemed enemies to the government hence the proverbial phrase of hes an honest man and eats no fish to signify hes a friend to the government and a protestant ii27 for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a god kissing carrion——have you a daughter ie hamlet having just remarked that honesty is very rare in the world adds that since there is so little virtue since corruption abounds everywhere and maggots are bred by the sun which is a god even in a dead dog polonius ought to take care to prevent his daughter from walking in the sun lest she should prove a breeder of sinners for though conception understanding in general be a blessing yet as ophelia might chance to conceive to be pregnant it might be a calamity hamlets abrupt question have you a daughter is evidently intended to impress polonius with the belief of the princes madness—malone ii28 the satirical rogue hamlet alludes to juvenal who in his 10th satire describes the evils of long life ii29 how pregnant his replies big with meaning ii30 beaten way of friendship plain track open and unceremonious course ii31 rights of our fellowship and constancy of our youth habits of familiar intercourse and correspondent years ii32 a better proposer an advocate of more address in shaping his aims who could make a stronger appeal ii33 even without inclination any way ii34 nay then i have an eye of you ie i have a glimpse of your meaning hamlets penetration having shown him that his two friends are set over him as spies ii35 so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather be beforehand with your discovery and the plume and gloss of your secret pledge be in no feather shed or tarnished ii36 express according to pattern justly and perfectly modelled ii37 paragon model of perfection ii38 lenten entertainment ie sparing like the entertainments given in lent ii39 we coted them on the way to cote is to pass by to pass the side of another it appears to be a word of french origin and was a common sporting term in shakespeares time ii40 the humorous man shall end his part in peace the fretful or capricious man shall vent the whole of his spleen undisturbed ii41 the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt fort ie the lady shall mar the measure of the verse rather than not express herself freely and fully ii42 travel become strollers ii43

mockery ii45 in little in miniature ii46 i know a hawk from a hernshaw a hernshaw is a heron or hern to know a hawk from a hernshaw is an ancient proverb sometimes corrupted into handsaw spencer quotes the proverb as meaning wise enough to know the hawk from its game ii47 buz buz sir william blackstone states that buz used to be an interjection at oxford when any one began a story that was generally known before ii48 then came each actor on his ass this seems to be a line of a ballad ii49 seneca cannot be too heavy nor plautus too light an english translation of the tragedies of seneca was published in 1581 and one comedy of plautus viz the menœchme in 1595 ii50 for the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men the probable meaning of this passage is—for the observance of the rules of the drama while they take such liberties as are allowable they are the only men—writ is an old word for writing ii51 as by lot god wot there was an old ballad entitled the song of jephthah from which these lines are probably quotations the story of jephthah was also one of the favourite subjects of ancient tapestry ii52 the first row of the pious chanson this expression does not appear to be very well understood steevens tells us that the pious chansons were a kind of christmas carols containing some scriptural history thrown into loose rhymes and sung about the streets the first row appears to mean the first division of one of these ii53 my abridgment comes hamlet alludes to the players whose approach will shorten his talk ii54 thy face is valanced ie fringed with a beard the valance is the fringes or drapery hanging round the tester of a bed ii55 comst thou to beard me to beard anciently meant to set at defiance hamlet having just told the player that his face is valanced is playing upon the word beard ii56 by the altitude of a chopine a chioppine is a high shoe or rather clog worn by the italians venice was more famous for them than any other place they are described as having been made of wood covered with coloured leather and sometimes even half a yard high their altitude being proportioned to the rank of the lady so that they could not walk without being supported ii57 like french falconers the french seem to have been the first and noblest falconers in the western part of europe the french king sent over his falconers to show that sport to king james the first —see weldons court of king james ii58 quality qualifications faculty ii59 caviare to the general caviare is the spawn of fish pickled salted and dried it is imported from russia and was considered in the time of shakespeare a new and fashionable luxury not obtained or relished by the vulgar and therefore used by him to signify anything above their comprehension—general is here used for the people ii60 as much modesty as cunning as much propriety and decorum as skill ii61 falls with the whiff and wind of his fell sword our author employs the same image in almost the same phrase the grecians fall even in the fan and wind of your fair sword tr cress v 3 tr ii62 the rack the clouds or congregated vapour ii63 the mobled queen mobled is veiled muffled disguised ii64 all his visage wannd ie turned pale or wan ii65 his whole functions suiting with forms to his conceit ie his powers and faculties—the whole energies of his soul and body giving material forms to his passion such as tone of voice expression of face requisite action in accordance with the ideas that floated in his conceit or imagination ii66 the cue the point—the direction ii67 like john adreams or dreaming john a name apparently coined to suit a dreaming stupid person he seems to have been a wellknown character ii68 unpregnant of my cause ie not quickened with a new desire of vengeance not teeming with revenge ii69 defeat was made overthrow ii70 lack gall to make oppression bitter ie lack gall to make me feel the bitterness of oppression ii71 kindless unnatural ii72 about my brains wits
